Issues
======

Let's say you have found a bug in the code or want to request propose some new functionality for a code that is in some repo on GitHub.
A good way to do it is to use Issues to keep the track record.

On the GitHub web-page associated with the repo, you can find an Issues tab.

   :alt: Issues


There, you will see opened and closed issues, search through them, sort etc. To create a new Issue simply click on ``New Issue`` on the right.

GitHub uses MarkDown with some extra features for formating comments and messages ont GitHub web-pages.
You can read about the basics of formatting on the `github documentation <https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax>`_.

Pull requests

When you have developed some code and want other people to use it. For that, you will need to create a Pull Request.
