Basic Rules for the course
==========================



  #. Write your scripts/notebooks the clone of your eScience2024-projects fork.
  #. Work in your ``Group#`` subfolder in the clone (you or even deeper) to reduce number of potential conflicts when merging.
  #. Do not store data in that folder unless it is \< 10 Mb.
  #. If you want to share larger data let ``@mvdebolskiy`` know to put it into the shared data folder (which is read-only).
  #. Do not download large number of files/large datasets into your home directory. 
  #. If there are files tha are automatically created in that folder but should not be there, update `.gitignore`
  #. Do not try to make files in the read-only folders (you will get errors on save). Mind where your File browser is when making new notebook/starting new Launcher.
  #. Read documentation.
